= Hidden Fields

Since the portal knows who a user is, we no longer need to ask users for
their email, name etc in the typeform. Instead, the portal can pass this
information through so it can still be collected.

To do so, add the following hidden fields to typeform. The table below
shows the hidden field to add, an example value for the field and a
description. portal_user_id, activity_instance and module_instance are
*REQUIRED* for any typeform to work with the portal.
